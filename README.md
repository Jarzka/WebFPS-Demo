This is my personal web-based FPS game project, created mainly for learning purposes.

You can play the latest stable (master) version here (Firefox is the only supported browser atm): www.voimala.org/projects/webfps_demo

The project is currently on very early stage. The following problems are known:
- Mouselook is buggy on Chrome for an uknown reason. This is the top priority bug to be fixed.
- Pointerlock API does not work on IE
- Player can see through walls (because technically player is just a dot in the game world without its own collision mask)

 At least the following features are planned to be implemented before this demo project is "done":
- Better collision detection
- Vertical mouselook
- Jumping
- Gun in a hand
- Shooting with the gun
- Ammo & reloading
